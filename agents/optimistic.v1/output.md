Title: HabitOS – Your Personal Operating System for Behavior

Core Idea:
A habit-building app that adapts in real time using behavioral science and AI to guide users moment-by-moment, not just with reminders.

Key Features:
 - AI-generated “micro-habits” based on daily energy levels
 - Real-time adaptive nudges (tone, timing, intensity)
 - Gamified habit streaks with narrative progression
  - Integration with wearables and calendar data

Why This Could Win:
Most habit apps are static. HabitOS evolves with the user, creating a deeply personalized system that feels alive.
