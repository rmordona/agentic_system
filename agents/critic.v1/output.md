Major Risks:
  - Heavy reliance on AI personalization may overpromise
  - Wearable integration limits user base
  - High development complexity

Unrealistic Assumptions:
  - Users will grant deep personal data access
  - AI can accurately infer motivation states

Failure Scenarios:
  - Users feel monitored rather than supported
  - Personalization becomes inconsistent or wrong

What Would Need to Change:
  - Clear privacy controls
  - Manual override and transparency
